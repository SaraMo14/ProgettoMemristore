#MemristorOscillators

MemristorOscillators is a Matlab project for simulating Chua's chaotic circuits.

To start the programme, run the file 'plottest.m'.
The remaining files define auxiliary functions invoked by the opening script to solve equations/systems of equations of each circuit.
When loading the GUI, the user can select from the pop-up menu which figure to plot (the number of the figure is the same that appears on the report).
Advised initial conditions are shown by default, but it is possible to change them or generate them randomly by clicking on the appropriate button.
Once the plot is loaded, it is possible to visualize the animation by clicking on 'Simulation'.
When the simulation is over, the user can plot the figure again or choose another one from the list.
